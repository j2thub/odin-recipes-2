    <h1>Homemade Pretzel</h1>
    <img src="./images/pretzel.jpg">
    <p>A soft, warm pretzel is a delicious reminder of my study abroad experience in Munich, Germany. In the states, it's hard to find
        one that compares to the large, golden-brown bread found in my favorite city in Europe. Today, we are going to learn how to make
        an authentic recreation of the traditional bavarian beer-snack.
